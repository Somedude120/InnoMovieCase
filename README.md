Requirement to work:
Should work on most OS but its a 3.1 netcore application. It might need 3.1 .NET core
The program is made for Windows OS although its made in .NET core
The Console.Clear() function will not work and it might show minor bugs on any other kinds of systems beside Windows
The program will not function without the folder "Movie product data" given by the caseholders which contains: CurrentUserSession.txt, Products.txt, README.txt, Users.txt
The program is not dynamical made to allow change of structure and if adding ex. a new product, follow the already made structure in README.txt
The Movie product data folder needs to be located in the same folder as the application for functioning

The main program is located at publish
The file is named InnoMovieCase.exe and as always is not signed
